An addon for BTWCE 2.1.4 but will be updated for 3.0 as soon as the dev enviroment is avalible. Required for my texture pack [Better-Than-Default](https://github.com/Polar-Onyx/Better-Than-Default/)

## Features:
- Allows the gui to be translucent (instead of only opaque)
- Removes the black overlay from menu backgrounds
- Makes all menu text white (may be configurable in the future)

## Installation
Simply [Download](https://github.com/BTW-Community/Translucency-Addon/releases/) the latest Translucency.jar and place it in ``.minecraft\mods`` or drag and drop via multimc/prism ``Edit instance > loader mods``

Note: You will need a texture pack with translucent textures to make us of it's features

## Preview
Never let a creeper sneak up on you again!
